Flutter Application Name - SunSync (Smart Daylight Activity Manager)
GitHub Repository - [https://github.com/Youngwer/SunSync](https://github.com/Youngwer/SunSync)

## Introduction to Application
SunSync is a mobile application designed to help users reconnect their daily activities with natural light patterns. It addresses the problem of modern indoor lifestyles that disconnect us from beneficial natural light cycles. The app features three main components: a weather tracking system that provides real-time data on outdoor conditions and sun position, an indoor light monitoring system that connects to an Arduino-based light sensor to track ambient brightness, and a smart reminder system that helps schedule activities at optimal light times. 

SunSync integrates hardware and software to create a comprehensive solution. The app collects light data using MQTT protocol from an Arduino MKR1010 microcontroller with a light sensor, displays real-time weather information from the OpenMeteo API, and stores user preferences and light history using Firebase. With an intuitive interface featuring dynamic backgrounds that change based on light conditions, SunSync helps users make better use of daylight through personalized activity recommendations and reminders tied to sunrise and sunset times.
